# Stringy

This contains Solidity code to set and return a message string from a contract address.

The contract contains a string variable that returns a message.

It also contains three functions:

1) The Stringy function initialises the message to "here I am!".

2) The setStringy function is a method to set the message to an arbitrary string.

3) The getStringy function is a method to retrieve the string that is stored as the message in the contract.
